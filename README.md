# STOmics-wheat-script
Scripts used to analyse wheat seed spatial transcriptomics data (largely based on the Stereopy library API) towards Spatial transcriptomics of developing wheat seed reveals radial expression pattern in endosperm and subgenome biased expression of key genes.

STOmics wheat analysis.py - Script for processing GEF file and generating spatial leiden gene expression clusters, largely follows scripts from Stereopy library (https://stereopy.readthedocs.io/)

perumtation_test_function_and_script.rmd - script for permutation tests between target genes and clusters to determine cluster specific and subgenome specific differences in expression across target genes
